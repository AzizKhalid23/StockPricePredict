Stock Price Prediction with LSTM,
This Python script utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting the next day's stock price. The data is sourced using the yfinance library and the model is implemented using TensorFlow. Below are the steps and details for understanding and running the code:

Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas yfinance scikit-learn tensorflow
Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook or script where the code is implemented.
Modify the company, start, and end variables to select the stock and date range of interest.
Run the script.
Workflow
Data Collection:

The script uses the yfinance library to download historical stock prices for a specific company within a given date range.
Data Preprocessing:

The closing prices are scaled using MinMaxScaler to fit values between 0 and 1.
Sequences of closing prices are created for training the LSTM model.
Model Training:

A sequential LSTM model is built using TensorFlow's Keras API.
The model is trained on the historical stock data.
Testing and Prediction:

The script downloads additional recent stock data for testing.
The model is used to predict the stock prices for the testing period.
Visualization:

Actual and predicted stock prices are plotted using matplotlib for visual analysis.
Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of three layers with dropout for regularization.
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.
Results
The script generates a plot comparing actual and predicted stock prices.
The final prediction for the next day's stock price is displayed.
Feel free to explore and experiment with different companies, date ranges, and model hyperparameters. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to open an issue or contribute.
